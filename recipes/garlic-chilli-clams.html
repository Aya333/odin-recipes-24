          Heat the olive oil in a lidded frying pan and fry the parma ham until
          crisp. Add the garlic and chilli, and gently fry for 3 minutes or
          until soft. Add the white wine and, once bubbling, add the clams, put
          on the lid and cook for 5-6 minutes, shaking the pan, until all of the
          clams are open.
